## 📊 Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

This project is part of my Analytics Portfolio, designed to provide actionable insights into a financial company’s loan performance. The dashboard was built using a real-world banking dataset comprising over 38,000 loan applications and delivers end-to-end visibility into loan funding, repayments, interest rates, and default risks.

## 🧠 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to help the financial company understand how loans are performing, including:

Total funded vs. received amounts

Average interest rate and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios

Good vs. bad loans segmentation

Key business metrics across time, geography, and customer segments

Forecasting future repayments and revenue

## 📁 Dataset Overview
📌 Total Records Used: 30,000+

## 🧮 Key Columns: 
loan_amount, int_rate, installment, loan_status, grade, address_state, emp_length, home_ownership, purpose, term, etc.

# 🔐 Sensitive fields anonymized to maintain data privacy

# 🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI Desktop – for interactive visualizations and dashboard building

Excel / Google Sheets – for data cleaning and transformation

DAX & Power Query – for calculated fields, measures, and RLS

AI Assistant – Created an AI agent for automated financial reporting using additional datasets

# 🔐 Row-Level Security (RLS)
RLS was implemented to:

Restrict data visibility based on address_state for regional managers

Secure sensitive insights based on user roles

Example: Users only see loans from the states they're responsible for

# 🎯 Key Business Insights
Most loans issued were for Debt Consolidation and Credit Cards

Majority of applicants have employment experience of 10+ years

Loans with terms of 36 months dominate the portfolio

Renters and Mortgage holders are the majority customer base

# 🗂️ Presentation & Reporting
A stakeholder-friendly PowerPoint deck was prepared to present the story behind the data

Integrated AI-generated financial narratives for automated commentary and reporting
